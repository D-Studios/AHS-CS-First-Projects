## How to Submit a Project Code

1. In the beginning, make sure to have someone who knows how to use GitHub guide you through the process, but these are the main steps.
2. Create a **branch** (naming: `LAST NAME, FIRST NAME`) from the master.
3. **Clone** the branch onto your local drive either through ==GitHub Desktop== (beginners) or through a ==.zip file== (intermediate and beyond). You can delete this later if you are using a school laptop; just make sure to save!
4. Create a folder in the **corresponding school year** in which you worked on this project.
5. Name the folder in this format: `LAST NAME, FIRST NAME`.
6. Now, you can put **all** of your code into this folder.

> After every project, create a **pull request** from your branch **to the master**. An officer will approve and merge your code so we can publish your amazing work :happy:!

> Now, **please** make the officers life easier by **organizing** your work by each project that you do :smiley:!

> If you have any questions, feel free to ask the **officers** or refer to the **GitHub** documentation.
